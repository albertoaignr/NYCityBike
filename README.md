## Summary 

The bikesharing program reported more than 2 million users for the month, which is a good representation for approximately +8.3 million for the census in 2019<sup>1</sup>, if its assumed that most of the users are locals. From the heatmaps, it could be seen a pattern of usage of citybikes on the commute hours for 9-5 jobs, indicating a lot of people use this service as transportation method to go to work. 

On the other hand,the city of Des Moines with a population of 214,237<sup>2</sup>, a median resident age 35-36 years<sup>3</sup> (similar for both cities) and 0.4% bicycle used as a transportation method<sup>4</sup>, is the target of a solid business proposal. 

Comparing this cities it could be made a fair assuption that a well built bikesharing service will be used by similar proportion of users on Des Moines, resulting in a rough number of 60k potential users to be part of this service.
